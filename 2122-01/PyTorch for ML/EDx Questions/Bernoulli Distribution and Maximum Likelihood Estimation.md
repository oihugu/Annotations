## To find the parameter values of the Bernoulli Distribution, we do not maximize the likelihood function but the

Log of the likelihood function

## An example of the Bernoulli Distributed variable is:

The face of a coin after a flip

## The location of the maximum of the likelihood when tanking the log of the likelihood function

Is not changed by taking the log
